# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Run Monte Carlo Simulation 
This project runs Monte Carlo Simulation of Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution , Exponential Distribution, Multinomial Distribution ,Normal Distribution. Then the results would compare t-statistic, Bootstrap statistic and randomized versions of t-statistic and Bootstrap statistic with 95% percentile z-statistic of a standard normal distribution to see whether it fits the theology.
